# PS Lab: Salesforce Permission Set & Group Analyzer

PS Lab is a powerful suite of Lightning Web Components designed to help Salesforce Administrators, Developers, and Architects visualize, analyze, and audit their org's permission structure. It transforms the complexity of Permission Sets and Permission Set Groups into an intuitive, interactive, and searchable hierarchy.

Managing permissions in a Salesforce org can be challenging. It's often difficult to answer simple questions like "Who has access to this Apex Class?" or "Which Permission Sets are giving access to certain objects and fields?". PS Lab provides the tools to answer these questions quickly and accurately.

# Key Features
* **Interactive Hierarchy Visualization**: Utilizes D3.js to render a dynamic, expandable tree diagram of all Permission Set Groups and standalone Permission Sets in your org.
* **Powerful Permission Detection**: Search for specific permissions, such as Object/Field access, Apex Class access, Custom Permissions, etc..., and instantly see which Permission Sets and Permission Set Groups grant them.
* **UserSpecific Analysis**: View the permission hierarchy as it is assigned to a specific user, making it easy to troubleshoot and audit individual access levels.
* **CSV Export**: Select a Permission Set and export its complete configuration to a CSV file for offline analysis and documentation.
